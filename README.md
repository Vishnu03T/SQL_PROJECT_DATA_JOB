# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.
Data hails from my [SQL Course] (https:/ Lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.
### The questions I wanted to answer through my queries:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top_paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to develop?
# Tools I used
- SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- Visual Studio Code: My go-tg for database management and executing SQL queries.
- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question:
### Top paying Data Analyst jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This quen highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.
### SQL Query to Find Top 10 Highest-Paying Data Analyst Jobs

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_hour_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
